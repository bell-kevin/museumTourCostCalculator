# museumTourCostCalculator
"Museum Sales with assigned input", and modify it so that the user specifies the number of students, and the number for each T-Shirt size. Make sure that the user types responses on the same line as the question. Test it by using the same number of students and the different size T-Shirts from project #1. Take a screenshot showing the screen with the userâ€™s input as well as the total cost. Then run it again with different numbers and take another screenshot.
